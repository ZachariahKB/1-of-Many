# <First of Many>

## Description

An early attempt in my coding bootcamp to optimize a HTML/CSS webpage, using better semantics and more efficient code.

My motivation is to demonstrate that i can identify and fix in-eficent code
I built this project to demonstrate how many problems inefficent code can cause.
It solves the problem of a buggy webpage. Also, the semantics help the webpage become more sucessful
I learned how changing one thing in HTML means I have to change the according code in CSS.
